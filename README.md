## Why This Exists

Discord used to have a "Favorites" feature that allowed users to organize their most important channels and DMs into a dedicated favorites section. However, **Discord soft-removed this feature** from their client interface, making it impossible to manage your favorites through the normal Discord app.

The favorites data still exists in your Discord settings, but there's no way to:
- ‚úÖ Add new channels to favorites
- ‚úÖ Remove channels from favorites  
- ‚úÖ Organize favorites into sections
- ‚úÖ Reorder your favorite channels
- ‚úÖ Edit channel nicknames in favorites

**Discord Favorites Manager** brings back full control over your favorites by directly interfacing with Discord's API to manage this hidden feature.

## How to Get Your Discord Token

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: Never share your Discord token with anyone! This application stores your token locally and encrypted.

1. **Open Discord in your web browser** (not the desktop app)
2. **Open Developer Tools** by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac)
3. **Go to the Network tab** and refresh the page (`F5` or `Ctrl+R`)
4. **Look for any request** in the network tab
5. **Click on a request** and find the **"Authorization"** header in the request headers
6. **Copy the token value** (it should be a long string of characters, 70+ characters)

The token will look something like: `OTAzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMUwUSexc4.GhIjKl.MnOpQrStUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWx`

## Usage

1. **Launch the application**
2. **Enter your Discord token** in the login screen
3. **Check "Remember token"** if you want to auto-login next time (recommended)
4. **Click "Connect to Discord"**

Once connected, you can:

### Adding Favorites
- **Add Section**: Click "Add Section" to create a new category
- **Add Channel**: Click "Add Channel" to add any Discord channel or DM
- **Channel IDs**: Right-click any channel in Discord and select "Copy ID" (requires Developer Mode enabled)

### Managing Favorites
- **Reorder**: Use the up/down arrow buttons to reorder items
- **Edit Names**: Click the three-dot menu and select "Edit Name/Nickname"
- **Move to Section**: Drag channels into sections or use the move buttons
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted favorites using the three-dot menu

### Backup & Restore
- **Export**: Save your favorites configuration to a JSON file
- **Import**: Restore favorites from a previously exported file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
